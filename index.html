                <p>Neptune, the farthest planet from the sun, is an ice giant with a distinctive blue color due to methane, and it's known for its strong winds and 14 moons, including the potentially captured dwarf planet, Triton. </p>
                <p>Dark, cold, and whipped by supersonic winds, ice giant Neptune is more than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth. Neptune is the only planet in our solar system not visible to the naked eye. In 2011 Neptune completed its first 165-year orbit since its discovery in 1846. Neptune is so far from the Sun that high noon on the big blue planet would seem like dim twilight to us. The warm light we see here on our home planet is roughly 900 times as bright as sunlight on Neptune.</p>
