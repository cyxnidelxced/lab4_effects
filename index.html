            <div class="effect-description">
                <p>The <code>shape-outside</code> CSS property defines a shape around which adjacent inline content should wrap, allowing text to flow around cosmic objects and stellar formations.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="shape-outside-demo">
                <div class="shape-circle"></div>
                <p>This text is flowing around a cosmic orb. Just as stellar gases and cosmic dust flow around celestial bodies, the shape-outside property allows content to embrace curves and contours instead of rigid rectangular boundaries. Notice how the text follows the perfect circular shape of this cosmic body, creating a harmonious relationship between text and image.</p>
                <div class="shape-star"></div>
                <p>Here we're witnessing a stellar phenomenonâ€”a star. For this stellar object, we've also made the visual appearance to match the shape that the text is flowing around. As in space where gravitational forces create complex orbits and paths, there boundless possibilities for creative layouts and text-wrapping patterns.</p>
